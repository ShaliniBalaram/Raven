# RAVEN Project Overview

## Introduction

The RAVEN project implements a comparative analysis of lumped versus semi-distributed hydrological models for flood prediction using the Raven modeling framework. This document provides a high-level overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.

## Project Objectives

1. **Compare Model Performance**: Evaluate and compare the performance of lumped and semi-distributed hydrological models for predicting river flow in the Nith River watershed.

2. **Optimize Flood Prediction**: Identify which modeling approach provides better predictive capability for flood events.

3. **Assess Data Requirements**: Determine the data requirements and computational costs for each modeling approach.

4. **Develop Best Practices**: Establish best practices for hydrological modeling of flood events in similar watersheds.

## Methodology

The project methodology includes the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**
   - Hydrometric data acquisition from Water Survey of Canada
   - Weather data collection from Environment Canada stations
   - DEM and land use data processing

2. **Model Setup**
   - Lumped model configuration
   - Semi-distributed model configuration with spatial discretization
   - Parameter initialization

3. **Model Calibration and Validation**
   - Automated calibration process
   - Split-sample validation
   - Performance metrics calculation (NSE, PBIAS, KGE)

4. **Flood Event Analysis**
   - Flood event identification using flow percentile approach
   - Event-specific performance assessment
   - Peak flow timing and magnitude analysis

5. **Results Interpretation**
   - Statistical comparison of model results
   - Visualization of hydrographs and performance metrics
   - Interpretation of strengths and limitations

## Expected Outcomes

1. Quantified performance metrics for both modeling approaches
2. Identification of conditions where each model type performs best
3. Recommendations for operational flood forecasting applications
4. Visualization and presentation materials for stakeholder communication
